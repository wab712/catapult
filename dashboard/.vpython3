# This is a vpython "spec" file, meant specifically for the chromeperf
# dashboard GAE app and associated services defined in catapult/dashboard.
#
# Try to keep this in sync with packages/versions declared in the
# requirements.txt file in this same directory.
#
# Read more about `vpython` and how to modify this file here:
#   https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/master/doc/users/vpython.md

python_version: "3.8"

# Used by:
#   vpython3 bin/run_py_test
# This is used in pre-submit try jobs, which used to rely on gae-sdk from cipd,
# and in post-submit cloud biulds, which used to rely on google/cloud-sdk
# docker image. Both sources are out of date and do not support python 3.
