"""Helpers for handling Buganizer migration.

Monorail is being deprecated and replaced by Buganizer in 2024. Migration
happens by projects. Chromeperf needs to support both Monorail and Buganizer
during the migration until the last project we supported is fully migrated.

Before the first migration happens, we will keep the consumers untouched
in the Monorail fashion. The requests and responses to and from Buganizer will
be reconciled to the Monorail format on perf_issue_service.
